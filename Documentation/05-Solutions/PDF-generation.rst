Individual Python packages
==========================

Intention
=========

Python packages usually are distributed in a single "wheel" file named
`SOMETHING.whl`. Quite a bunch of such packages come installed with the
container and ready for use. There may be situations however where wished there
was an extra package installed or a different version. The container can handle
this "on the fly" for single runs and saves you the hassle of having to
`docker build` a specialized image.


How does it work?
=================

Within the container several convenience scripts (bash) are working and you
can select an action from the menu. The scripts now have an eye on the
:file:`/WHEELS` folder within the container. If there are :file:`*.whl` files
these are installed "on the fly" for the single run, for example, before
rendering takes place. Additionally a `pip freeze` command is run and reveals
in the listing on the console what exact Python packages are going to be used.
The idea is of course that you do a volume mapping to provide the wheels
packages and the :file:`/WHEELS` folder is otherwise empty by default.

Theme development is a perfect use case.
Let's say you want to try a variant of our theme `sphinx_typo3_theme`_.
Make some changes and as a result of your work build a local wheel file like
:file:`mywheels/sphinx_typo3_theme-4.2.1.dev4+ge50e4ff-py2.py3-none-any.whl`.
If you  then map the :file:`mywheels` folder into the container the modified
theme will be installed on the fly and will be used in the subsequent rendering.


Example 1
=========

Here you create a folder with a special name und use the `dockrun_t3rd`
command::

   # Think of ~/project/Documentation and go to your project
   cd ~/project

   # make a temp folder with this special name
   mkdir tmp-GENERATED-Wheels

   # place your wheel file(s) there
   cp fromsomewhere/sphinx_typo3_theme-4.2.1.dev4+ge50e4ff-py2.py3-none-any.whl tmp-GENERATED-Wheels/

   # Use the dockrun_t3rd command for rendering. It knows about the special name
   dockrun_t3rd makehtml


.. tip:: Use a global :file:`.gitignore` file and add the line `*GENERATED*`.


Example 2
=========

You may as well use the `dockrun_t3rd` command in junction with a special
environment variable::

   # Think of ~/project/Documentation and go to your project
   cd ~/project

   # specify the absolute path to your folder with wheel packages
   T3DOCS_WHEELS=/home/me/mywheels

   # ask for some extra console output for your enlightment
   T3DOCS_DEBUG=1

   # Use the dockrun_t3rd command for rendering. It knows about the envvars
   dockrun_t3rd makehtml


Example output
==============

In both the examples you should see on the console something like this:

.. code-block:: none

   âžœ  dockrun_t3rd  makehtml

Limitations
===========

Note that this method of "on the fly installation" is limited to updating
Python packages only. You *can* install a `sphinxcontrib-plantuml` extension
for example. However, it will not work because the required Java packages are
not installed in the container.
