About this manual
=================

Everything about the container: How it works, how it's developed,
how it is built and ways of using it.

This container is a beast, it has lots of features and lots of knowledge
went in. This manual hopefully helps to access the many features.

The container is used for rendering the official TYPO3 documentation.
It can easily be used in a local, personal environment as well. It is not
limited to generating TYPO3 documentation only.


Operating systems

For Linux, Mac and Windows.

At its core Docker is a Linux solution. `Docker Machine
<https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/>`__ has come to make it run on Mac
and Windows as well. The container will run just the same on Linux, Mac and
Windows.

However, most of this manual is written from the perspective of a Linux user
when it comes to "How to use the container."

If you are on Windows and can help to port the solutions to Windows - you are
welcome. Very much!
