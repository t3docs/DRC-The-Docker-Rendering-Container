**About this manual**

Everything about the container: How it works, how it's developed,
how it is built and ways of using it.

This container is a beast, it has lots of features and lots of knowledge
built in. This manual hopefully helps to access the features.

The container is used for rendering the official TYPO3 documentation
on the docs server.

.. _operating-systems:

**Operating systems**

For Linux, Mac and Windows.

At its core Docker is a Linux solution. `Docker Machine
<https://docs.docker.com/machine/overview/>`__ has come to make it run on Mac
and Windows as well. The container will run just the same on Linux, Mac and
Windows.

However, most of this manual is written from the perspective of a Linux user
when it comes to "How to use the container."

If you are on Windows and can help to port the solutions to Windows - you are
welcome. Very much!
