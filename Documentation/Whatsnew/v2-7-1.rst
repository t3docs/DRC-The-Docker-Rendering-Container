.. index:: HTML styling; full width display

New: Use full width of large screens
====================================

For the sake of good readability and "beauty" the HTML theme is limiting the
width of the content area to a certain maximum:

.. figure:: Files/v2-7-1-full-width-500-1.png
   :class: with-border with-shadow
   :alt: Screenshot of HTML page layout with limited content width

However, the larger your screen is the more space is wasted, which can be
annoying if you want to see extra wide tables or code blocks.

**New:** You can now make your browser window really wide (>1.800px) to trigger
a mode switch. With that all of your window will be used for content:

   :class: with-border with-shadow
   :alt: Screenshot of HTML page layout with full width content






Updated: Ubuntu 20.04
=====================

The container is now based on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. The OS name and version is now
part of the 'versioninfo' output. When called with the `--version` option the
values for OS_NAME and OS_VERSION are shown as well:

   :class: with-border with-shadow
   :alt: Screenshot of the text output when called with the --version option




.. index:: Sphinx extension; googlemaps

Removed: googlemaps
===================

The Sphinx extension `sphinxcontrib.googlemaps` was removed because it didn't
work any more.


.. index:: Sphinx extension; googlechart

Removed: googlechart
====================

The Sphinx extension `sphinxcontrib.googlechart` was removed because Google has

New: Styled index page

aligned without list symbols. The layout works well on small display like
cell phones:
