NEW: How to edit button
=======================

.. versionadded:: 2.8.0

v2.8 of the :term:`DRC` is using v4.5 of the `sphinx-typo3-theme`_. The actual changes
are made in the theme.

At the top right of our pages we usually show the "Edit on GitHub" and "Show
source" buttons:

   :class: with-border with-shadow
   :alt:   Screenshot of the 'Edit on GitHub' button

It is desirable to give users help about what they have to expect when they
click the edit button. On the other hand we don't want to overload the
layout. As a solution there now is a third button which only appears while
hovering over the edit button:

   :class: with-border with-shadow
   :alt:   Screenshot of the 'How to edit' button

The "How to edit" button will take users to the `How to work with
GitHub <https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/docs-how-to-document/master/en-us/GitHub/>`__
page of the "Writing documentation" manual.

At the moment the link is hardcoded within the `sphinx-typo3-theme`_.


NEW: Sphinx can use parallel processes
======================================

We updated several Sphinx extensions. They now return the so called "extension
metadata" from their setup routine. They now signal True for "parallel_read_safe"
and "parallel_write_safe". We could verify that Sphinx now uses parallel
processes for writing. The extension `sphinxcontrib.t3targets` wasn't compatibel
with this change and got fixed.


NEW: Collapsed menu for TYPO3 Exceptions
========================================

.. versionadded:: 2.8.0

When TYPO3 throws an exception it often points to a page that is dealing with
that exception. See exceptions `1460976566
<https://docs.typo3.org/typo3cms/exceptions/master/en-us/Exceptions/1460976566.html>`__
for example. Usually the main menu at the left of the page is expanded to show
the menu item for the current page.
The theme.js that comes with `sphinx-typo3-theme`_ v4.5 has code that looks for
the 'TYPO3 Exceptions' item and collapses the submenu on page load.

Old: |expanded-menu|
New: |collapsed-menu|
