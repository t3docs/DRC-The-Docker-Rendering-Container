How to render TYPO3 Documentation the official way using Docker

The Docker image *t3docs/render-documentation* is used for building TYPO3
documentation. Such documentation is organized in Sphinx projects with
reStructuredText files. The Docker container knows how to transform ("render")
such a source project to produce the final documentation (a "manual"). Various
output formats like HTML or PDF are avaiable. A ready-to-use image is
available from Docker.
