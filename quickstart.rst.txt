Quickstart
==========

For Linux, Mac and Docker installed. Run the DRC as a tool on the command line
in a terminal window.

1. Download the container image.

   Do this once unless you want to check for a new version::

      # Download
      # Pull the container image.
      # Available tags:  ':latest' (default), ':develop'. The default can be omitted.
      docker pull ghcr.io/t3docs/render-documentation:latest

      # Rename
      # Save the image under its generic name as well.
      docker tag ghcr.io/t3docs/render-documentation:latest t3docs/render-documentation:latest

      # Verify
      # Run the image as a container, show help, and remove the container.
      docker run --rm t3docs/render-documentation:latest --help


2. Define a helper function in your terminal window.

   Do this once in every new terminal window.

   Add the eval line to your shell's startup file
   to always have this done automatically. Common startup files are `~/.bashrc`,
   `~/.fishrc` and `~/.zshrc`::

      # Define helper function in the current terminal
      eval $(docker run --rm t3docs/render-documentation:latest show-shell-commands)

      # Verify
      dockrun_t3rd --help


3. Render a project's documentation. Go to the PROJECT folder, NOT to the
   Documentation subfolder::

      # Run the DRC
      # Render some project's documentation located at PROJECT/Documentation.

      cd PROJECT
      dockrun_t3rd  makehtml-no-cache
